# Facial Recognition with Python 3 & OpenCV on Raspberry Pi 3

This is an Facial Recognition project using Python3/OpenCV, deployed on a Raspberry Pi 3. This will serve as a step by step comprehensive guide to build a a facial recognition program upon a RPI3, from initial flashing to finish. 


## Getting Started

This project is aimed at users of all levels. In general, I will be concise in my instruction, but will elaborate on harder-to-grasp concepts to ensure clarity. Over time, I will update this repo with practical applications for this project, but will not update instructions for prior commits. Have fun!


## Prerequisites

A few programs to install prior to this tutorial:

```
Etcher [https://etcher.io/]
