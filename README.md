# Facial Recognition with Python 3 & OpenCV on Raspberry Pi 3

This is an Facial Recognition project using Python3/OpenCV, deployed on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. This will serve as a step by step comprehensive guide to build a a facial recognition program upon a RPI3, from initial flashing to finish. 


## Getting Started

This project is aimed at the intermediate+ community, but beginners can figure it our with a little elbow grease. Have fun!


## Prerequisites

A few programs to install prior to this tutorial:

```
